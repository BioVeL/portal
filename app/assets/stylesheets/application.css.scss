 * Synopsis
 *
 * BioVeL Taverna Lite  is a prototype interface to Taverna Server which is
 * provided to support easy inspection and execution of workflows.
 *
 * For more details see http://www.biovel.eu
 *
 * BioVeL is funded by the European Commission 7th Framework Programme (FP7),
 * through the grant agreement number 283359.
 *
 *
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
